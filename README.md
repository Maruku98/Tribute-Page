# Futuristic Tribute Page ðŸ§ª
Futuristic tribute page dedicated to James Cameron and Avatar! 

## Overview
One of my first projects! ðŸ˜„ This was one of the first web pages I designed using only HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It was a cool experience to put everything I knew about responsive web design and styling into practice.<br></br>
The project consists of a tribute page to film director James Cameron, addressing his top-rated films, specially the fictional world of Pandora (Avatar).<br></br>
Thus, you will soon notice the futuristic styling I chose for this project. Aside from that, all text was directly extracted from Wikipedia.

## PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES USED
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript ES6

## STYLING
- The styling and visual effects were entirely done with CSS3, with no frameworks nor libraries. I used both simple and complex styling parameters to achieve an entirely responsive web page that rearranges its contents according to screen - width.
- Said rearranging of web content is handled with `media queries`.
- JavaScript is scarcely used in this project since I was just starting to learn about it. Some basic DOM methods like `.addEventListener`, `.getElementById` and mouse `events` are used to respond to basic user interactions by traversing the DOM.
- Music on! ðŸŽµ I even implemented two buttons to play or pause Pandora's ambient music.
- There's also a top navigation bar that takes the user directly to the different sections.
